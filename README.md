# TM_StringEditor
Takes an input TM.txt file that outlines the rules for which a string must follow. The program prompts the user for any input string, then adjusts the string as needed to fit the bounds of the turing machine. Each change is printed to the console. This was a class project, so the visibility is private.


# TM.txt Rules
A TM.txt file must follow the format:\
Line 1: Number of states in the TM\
Line 2: Halting states\
Line 3 - EOF: Transitions\

For an example, see the TM.txt file
